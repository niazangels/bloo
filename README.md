# Bloo!
_A tiny deep learning library from scratch in Python_

![alt text](images/bloo.png "Bloo!")

## But why?

What I cannot create, I do not understand.

This codebase follows the one hour coding madness of Joel Grus, [building a deep learning framework in under an hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw)!

Also, Joel has some strong opinions on [software engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U) and replicable research. I wanted to follow a pro typing docstrings, use type annotations, and run `mypy` for type checking while building something from scratch. I'm hooked now!
